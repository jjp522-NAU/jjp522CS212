        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hello, I am <b>Jake Preston</b>, a fourth-year student currently studying 
            Immersive Media and Games at Northern Arizona University. 
            I’m a Gameplay and Systems Designer passionate in creating experiences
            that elicit intense emotions from players. I have been working as 
            both the lead designer and team lead for many of my most recent projects
            which has given me a lot of experience managing a team and ensuring
            productivity. I am also a D1 track and field athlete and just recently 
            transferred from the University of California, Irvine to continue my 
            academic and athletic careers.
        </p>

        <h2>Projects Reference</h2>
        <p>
            <b>1.</b> The Milgram Experiment: <br>
            <small>The Milgram Experiment pushes the boundaries on what a game can be. It puts the player through the famous Milgram Experiment
                 and tests how they would react in the face of pleading and helpless citizens. Players take the role of a Patriot Test administrator 
                 in a fictional country. NPCs come in and take the test, with the player being instructed to “administer a motivational stimulus” 
                in response to any incorrect answers. The player must decide whether they will submit to authority and cruelly execute innocent civilians, or rebel and potentially save lives.</small> <br>
