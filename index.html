                    <p>
                        Hello, I am <b>Jake Preston</b>, a fourth-year student currently studying 
                        Immersive Media and Games at Northern Arizona University. 
                        I’m a Gameplay and Systems Designer passionate in creating experiences
                        that elicit intense emotions from players. I have been working as 
                        both the lead designer and team lead for many of my most recent projects
                        which has given me a lot of experience managing a team and ensuring
                        productivity. I am also a D1 track and field athlete and just recently 
                        transferred from the University of California, Irvine to continue my 
                        academic and athletic careers.

                                <small>The Milgram Experiment pushes the boundaries on what a game can be. It puts the player through the famous Milgram Experiment
                                    and tests how they would react in the face of pleading and helpless citizens. Players take the role of a Patriot Test administrator 
                                    in a fictional country. NPCs come in and take the test, with the player being instructed to “administer a motivational stimulus” 
                                    in response to any incorrect answers. The player must decide whether they will submit to authority and cruelly execute innocent civilians, or rebel and potentially save lives.</small> <br>
